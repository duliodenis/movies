# Movies
Movies is an iOS 10 App written in Swift 3 that uses the OMDB ([Open Movie Database](http://www.omdbapi.com/)) API to provide a delightful way to look-up and discover movies.

Movies is a rewrite of my Swift 2 [Films](https://github.com/duliodenis/films) project.

Movies allows the user to search for movies and uses Swift to parse the JSON returned by the OMDB API to provide the Rotten TomatoMeter Score as well as the rating, release date, and synopsis all with a delightfully simple UX.
